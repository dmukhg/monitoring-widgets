# Monitoring Widgets

A bunch of jQuery UI widgets that can be used to create dashboards for
monitoring purposes. Pure client side implementations of what I thought would
be most apt widgets for easy-to-use and actionable views of data.

## Level Widget

Shows the level of some value in percentage points. You need to provide it the
100% value to begin with. Doesn't know how to deal with values higher than
100% and starts blinking danger-red.
